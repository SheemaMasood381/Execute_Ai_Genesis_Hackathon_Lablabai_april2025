## üöÄ Overview

**ShopSmart.AI** uses intelligent agents built with **CrewAI** and entirely powered by **AIMLAPI** services:
- Product search and structured extraction (name, price, image URL, rating, etc.)
- LLM-based reasoning and recommendations
- Voice-to-text input handling (Whisper via AIMLAPI)
- Review summarization using RAG with embeddings (via AIMLAPI)
